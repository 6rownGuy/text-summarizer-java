# Text Summarizer
The text summarizer is made purely in java, without the use of any nlp libraries. The algorithm is pretty straight-forward and is quite effective. It breaks the whole text into sentences and determines the weight of each sentence. Sentences with highest weights are then displayed as the summary.

# Instructions
- Put the text that needs to be summarize in a text file.
- Run the code.
- Enter the file URL in the command line UI.
- The output (summary of the text) will be displayed on the screen.
